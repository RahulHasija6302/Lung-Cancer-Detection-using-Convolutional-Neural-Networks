Project Title: Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Problem Statement:
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. In this project, you will develop a CNN model to classify lung CT scan images as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The goal is to build an accurate and reliable model that can aid in the early detection of lung cancer.

Dataset:
You can use the "Lung Cancer Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which consists of a collection of lung CT scan images along with their corresponding labels. Each image is labeled as either 0 (benign) or 1 (malignant). The dataset is available for download on Kaggle and contains two folders: "0" for benign images and "1" for malignant images.

Project Steps:

Perform data exploration to understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Preprocess the data by resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build a CNN model using Keras or TensorFlow for lung cancer classification.
Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
Visualize the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different architectures to improve performance.
Discuss the results, including the model's accuracy, any challenges faced during the project, and potential areas for improvement.
Optionally, you can also explore techniques like transfer learning or ensemble models to enhance the model's performance.
