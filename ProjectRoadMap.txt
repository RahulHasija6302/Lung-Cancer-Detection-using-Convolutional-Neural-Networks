Step 1: Data Exploration

Load the dataset and examine its structure, including the number of images and their corresponding labels.
Display sample images from the dataset to get a visual understanding of the data.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Resize the images to a consistent size suitable for the CNN model.
Normalize the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using an 80:20 or 70:30 ratio.
Step 3: Model Building

Import the necessary libraries for building the CNN model, such as Keras or TensorFlow.
Define the architecture of the CNN model, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.
Step 4: Model Training

Train the CNN model using the training set.
Specify the number of epochs (iterations) and batch size for training.
Monitor the training process and observe the loss and accuracy improvements over each epoch.
Step 5: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's effectiveness.
Visualize the evaluation results using appropriate plots or charts.
Step 6: Model Fine-tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of layers, or filter sizes, to improve the model's performance.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find optimal values.
Step 7: Results and Discussion

Discuss the results obtained from the trained model, including its accuracy and performance metrics.
Analyze any challenges faced during the project and potential reasons behind them.
Suggest areas for improvement or future research directions.
